# Tammoz

using Android studio, Flutter project:
additional techniques and patterns:

- shadcn: ui
- drift : db
- bloc: state managment
- getit: dependency injection

remarks:

- for db for now estimation: app will serve two mobiles, and syncing dbs will be via SMSs
- for ui: no customization till last stages, and maybe request FlutterFlow help.
- for coding will use blackbox.ai to speed up process, with one master chat and second one for enquiries

With God's grace
